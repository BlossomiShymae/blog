## Introduction

Hiii, I'm Blossomi Shymae. I'm a trans elf girl that loves to do programming, drawing, or hanging out with friends. You can call me Blossomi (some friends call me Blossom or Bloss for short). I'm really shy with meeting new people, but I'm a sweet and friendly girl at heart that loves to hangout and help whenever I can.

I dream about being a vtuber, it may or may not happen some day...content creation is not an easy thing to do.

## Hobbies

These are my current hobbies:
- Programming
- Drawing art
- Video games

I love to do programming whenever I can in my free time. I'm familiar with langauges in the C-family such as C#, Rust, and Typescript. I know more programming languages but these are the main ones I'm currently focusing on at the time of this article. I often do projects that involve programming even though my skillset isn't that great. My preferred editors are Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio.

I also love to draw art! I have been practicing digital art the last few years but have never taken it seriously enough for the hardcore stuff. My persona is the main subject that I frequently do art on, which you can artworks of on my website. Anatomy is my weakest skill, so I have to heavily reference when I draw. Krita is the tool that I always use. 

For video games, I haven't really played within the last year. I'm unfortunately attached to play League of Legends as it is the only game I actually come back to. I sometimes play Minecraft though. x3

## Transition

For my transgender background, I'm a trans woman that is on the lifelong journey of exploring herself. To help with that, I'm on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This includes taking spironolactone (blocks testosterone) and injecting myself with estradiol valerate (estrogen). So far, I have really liked the results and is making me actually happy in life. I'm interested in taking progesterone within this year. :3

This is what I currently take for HRT at the time of this article:
- 100mg sprionolactone, twice a day
- 0.215ml of estradiol valerate, 20mg/mL concentration, every five days
  - 21ga drawing needle (1 in)
  - 27ga injecting needle (1 in)
  - 1ml luer slip syringe

I do intramuscular injection, alternating betwen my thighs every five days to obtain a trough over 200pg/ml for my estradiol levels. I'm aiming for estrogen monotherapy in the near future so I can cut out spironolactone. It'll take time as I'll need to get my levels checked and adjust as needed every three months for that goal.

I have used the following resource when researching for HRT:
